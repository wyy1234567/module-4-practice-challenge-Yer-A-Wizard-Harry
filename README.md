### Welcome to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter! Yer a Wizard
#### You've been recruited to build a Filter Hat - think of the Sorting Hat but the students are already placed.

All of our student's can be found here - http://hp-api.herokuapp.com/api/characters/students. 

Unfortunately, Ron was messing around with the Obliviate Spell (a.k.a 'The Forgetfullness Charm') and all of the students forgot how to group themselves. Fortunately for you, you know which house each student belongs to. Use your own magic (or just make a filter) so we can view students by house.

See below

Go ahead and use your imagination - add yourself to the list of students and assign yourself a house.
You should be able to see your name appear under list of students and you should appear in the filtered results for your new found house 
(**NOTE: this is only fan fiction - since you're already a flatiron student you can't actually attend Hogwartz. Any student you add to list of students will not persist and will disappear upon refresh**)
